# NDA Process Discovery - Simple Questions

## Template Questions

1. **Do you have a PDF template you use?** Can you send it to us?
2. **What information do you fill in?** (Counterparty name, email, dates, etc.)
3. **Do you have different templates for different types of NDAs?** Or just one template?
4. **How do you fill it out?** (Type directly in PDF, print and scan, etc.)

## Workflow Questions

5. **Walk me through your signature process:**
   - You fill out the template → send to customer
   - Customer signs → emails back to you
   - You forward to internal signature authority
   - Internal signature added
   - **Is this correct?**

6. **Who is the internal signature authority?** (One person, multiple people, specific role?)

7. **How do you track which NDAs are pending signature?** (Email, spreadsheet, memory?)

8. **Do you use DocuSign for any part of this?** Or is it all email-based?

9. **How do you know when an NDA expires?** (You mentioned some expired/near-expiration NDAs)

## Quick Follow-ups

10. **What takes the most time?** (Filling out templates, tracking signatures, managing expirations?)

11. **What would make this easier?** (Automated reminders, better tracking, etc.)
